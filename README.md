Dataset and code for ["BLADE: Benchmarking Language Model Agents for Data-Driven Science"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09667)

We are working on a hold-out test set. Details soon!

## üìù Introduction

BLADE is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate Language Model (LM) Agents on writing justifiable analyses on real-world scientific research questions from data (e.g., _Are soccer players with a dark skin tone more likely than those with a light skin tone to receive red cards from referees?_ from [Silberzahn et al.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2515245917747646)). In particular, BLADE evaluates Agents' ability to iteratively integrate scientific domain knowledge, statistical expertise, and data understanding to make nuanced analytical decisions

BLADE consists of X dataset and research question pairs with high-quality ground truth analysis decisions (i.e., choice of conceptual construct, transformations, statistical model) made by expert data scientists and researchers who independently conducted the analyses. In addition, BLADE contains Y multiple choice questions for discerning justifiable analysis decisions.

  <em><b>Overview of BLADE Construction and Evaluation.</b> We gathered research questions and datasets from existing research papers, crowd-sourced analysis studies and statistic textbooks as well as analyses from expert annotators (boxes 1-3). Given a research question and dataset, LM agents generate a full analysis containing the relevant conceptual variables, a data transform function, and a statistical modeling function (boxes 1, 4, and 5). BLADE then performs automatic evaluation against the ground truth (box 6).</em>

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with BLADE, follow the steps below:

### 1. Installation

```bash
# recommended to do this inside another environment
conda create --name blade python=3.10 -y
conda activate blade
pip install blade-bench
```

Or to install locally (developed in python=3.10.14):

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/behavioral-data/BLADE.git
cd BLADE
# install locally
pip install -e .
```

### 2. LM Setup

Next, set the API keys for different LM services. BLADE both not only evalutes Language Models but needs one for evaluation.

```bash
# for openai
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>

# for google gemini
export GEMINI_API_KEY=<your key>

# for anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your key>
```

Some default model configurations (e.g., environment variable for the api key) are specified in [llm_config.yml](blade_bench/conf/llm_config.yml). You can also set your own configurations by creating your own yaml file folloing the format in `llm_config.yml` and setting the environment variable `LLM_CONFIG_PATH` to the file.

Here's a minimal example to test that the llm is working.

```python
from blade_bench.llms import llm
gen = llm(provider="anthropic", model="claude-3.5-sonnet")
response = gen.generate([{"role": "user", "content": "Hello world"}])
```

### 3. Running LMs and Agent

We provide a starter script to run a basic one shot LM or ReACT agent for our benchmark.

```
Usage: run_gen_analyses.py [OPTIONS]

  For a given dataset and research question, generate analyses for the dataset
  using a language model or a basic ReAct agent that interacts with a notebook
  environment.

  Running this generates the following files in output_dir:

  - command.sh: A bash script that contains the command used to run this script
  - config.json: The configuration used to run this experiment
  - run.log: The log file for the multirun experiment
  - llm.log: The log file for LM prompts and responses for the experiment
  - multirun_analyses.json: The analyses generated. **Note**: This file is used in run_get_eval.py to get the evaluation results.
  - llm_analysis_*.py: The code generated for each run (if it was generated properly) for quick reference

Options:
  --run_dataset [fish|boxes|conversation|reading|crofoot|panda_nuts|fertility|hurricane|teachingratings|mortgage|soccer|affairs|amtl|caschools]
                                  Dataset to run  [required]
  -n, --num_runs INTEGER          Number of runs to perform  [default: 10]
  --use_agent                     Whether to use agent or just the base LM
  --no_cache_code_results         [ONLY used when use_agent=True] Whether to
  --no_cache_code_results         [ONLY used when use_agent=True] Whether to
                                  cache code results when running code.
  --no_use_data_desc              Whether to use data description in the
                                  prompts for the LM  [default: True]
  --llm_config_path FILE          Path to the LLM config file, used to specify
                                  the provider, model, and text generation
                                  config such as the temperature.  [default:
                                  ./conf/llm.yaml]
  --llm_provider [openai|azureopenai|groq|mistral|together|gemini|anthropic|huggingface]
                                  Provider for the LLM to override the config
                                  file at llm_config_path
  --llm_model TEXT                Model for the LLM to override the config
                                  file at llm_config_path.
  --llm_eval_config_path FILE     Path to the LLM eval config file, used to
                                  specify the provider, model, and text
                                  generation config such as the temperature.
                                  [default: ./conf/llm_eval.yaml]
  --output_dir DIRECTORY          output directory to store saved analyses
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

This will write the results to the folder specified by `output_dir`. After running the script, in the output folder, there will be a `multirun_analyses.json` file which is used for evaluation.

An example is provided in [example/multirun_analyses.json](example/multirun_analyses.json).

### 4. Evaluating Agent Generated Analyses

We provide a starter script to evaluate the outputs of `run_gen_analyses.py`. Run `run_get_eval.py` as follows:

```
Usage: run_get_eval.py [OPTIONS]

  Runs evaluation and saves the results to the output_dir directory. Running
  this saves the following key files:

  - command.sh: A bash script that contains the command used to run this script
  - eval_results.json of the EvalResults class
  - eval_metrics.json of the MetricsAcrossRuns class containing the metrics
  - llm_history.json of the LLM history class containing the prompt history

Options:
  --multirun_load_path FILE      [EITHER multirun_load_path or
                                 submission_load_path is REQUIRED] Path to
                                 load the multirun analyses.
  --submission_load_path FILE    [EITHER multirun_load_path or
                                 submission_load_path is REQUIRED]
  --llm_eval_config_path FILE    Path to the LLM eval config file
  --no_cache_code_results        Whether to not cache code results when
                                 running code for the evaluation
  --output_dir DIRECTORY         output directory to store saved eval results
  --ks TEXT                      List of k values for diversity metrics.
                                 Default is []
  --diversity_n_samples INTEGER  Number of samples to use for diversity
                                 metrics
  --help                         Show this message and exit.
```

Here is an example:

```bash
python run_get_eval.py --multirun_load_path ./examples/multirun_analyses.json
```

## üîç Data Exploration Functions

To access the dataset and research question we can:

```python
from blade_bench.data import load_dataset_info, list_datasets, DatasetInfo

all_datasets = list_datasets()
dinfo: DatasetInfo = load_dataset_info("soccer", load_df=True)
rq = dinfo.research_question
df = dinfo.df
```

To explore the ground truth annotations, we can:

```python
from blade_bench.data import load_ground_truth, AnnotationDBData

# each dataset annotations will be prepared when it is run the first time
gnd_truth: AnnotationDBData = load_ground_truth('soccer')
print(len(gnd_truth.transform_specs))
print(len(gnd_truth.cv_specs))
```

More details about the structure of the ground truth is available in the paper.

## üéØ Evaluating a Submission on BLADE

To evalute your own agent analysis for a dataset in BLADE, the LM agent must generate a `json` file that conforms to the schema in [example/submission_schema.json](example/submission_schema.json). An example is shown in [example/submission_analyses.json](example/submission_analyses.json). Then, we just need to specify --submission_load_path when running `run_get_eval.py`.

```bash
python run_get_eval.py --submission_load_path ./example/submission_analyses.json
```
